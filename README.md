# Cochlear-Implant-Neural-Hypothesis-Assessment

## Hypothesis Testing Model
The aim of this project is to construct neural predictive models to forecast post-cochlear implantation (CI) language outcomes across three medical centers in sensorinural hearing loss (SNHL). It will also build upon ongoing research by the project team on CI candidates to predict spoken language improvement in implanted children on the individual level using neural predictive modelling and to investigate the neural mechanisms that underlie the dynamic changes during the progressive stages of language development. More precise outcome prediction before surgery could assist caregivers and clinicians to plan more carefully and cost-effectively post-surgical speech and language intervention in order to optimize the potential of CI and each childâ€™s language learning ability.
